=========================

Practice exercises from the book Acclerated C++

This is meant to be a reference solution guide to anyone else working on these exercises. 
These solutions can certainly be improved (for instance, separating portions of code into better organized files) and are not throughly tested; however, they should satisfy the exercise requirements.
