=========================

Books are a great resource to learn more about programming, but sitting down and writing code is essential to gaining programming skills. This repository contains code that goes along with book chapters of books I've read to improve my C++ skills. This is meant to be a reference solution guide to anyone else working on similar exercises. The solutions provided can certainly be improved (for instance, separating portions of code into better organized files) and are not throughly tested; however, they should satisfy the exercise requirements.
